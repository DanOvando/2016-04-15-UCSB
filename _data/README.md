# Introduce Yourself

[Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) and [clone](http://remi-daigle.github.io/2016-04-15-UCSB/git/#25_clone_repository) this repository to your local machine. Introduce yourself by adding a tiny JSON (Javascript Object Notation) file per your **Github** USERNAME `USERNAME.json` under the [`_data/`](./_data/) directory. Here's an example for Github username `bbest`, so in a file named `bbest.json`:

```javascript
{
	"info": "Lecturer at Bren School"
}
```

Using the format above, replace with your own `info` of your choosing. Be sure to commit and push the changes (or in Github Desktop App "Commit and Sync"), and submit a pull request to the original repository.
